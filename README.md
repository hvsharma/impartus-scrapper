    course_urls = json.load(file_obj)

	
	with open("D:\\impartus-scrapper\\imp_config.json", 'r') as file_obj:
    credentials = json.load(file_obj)

	
	download_dir = "D:\\Lectures"


	command = f"python D:\\\impartus-scrapper\\\ilc_scrape.py -u {username} -p {password} -o -a both -q 720p " \
              f"-d {download_dir} -w 2 -c {url} --ignore-gooey"
